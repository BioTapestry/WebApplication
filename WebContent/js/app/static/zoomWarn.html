	You've just used &lt;Ctrl&gt; {ZOOMTYPE} to zoom. Please note, this will only change the <b>web browser</b>'s zoom settings 
	(eg. font sizes and image display sizes), which can result in a 'low resolution' or blurry look for the model.
	&lt;Ctrl&gt; {ZOOMTYPE} will not zoom the network model itself.
</p>
<p>
	To zoom in or out on the model, click anywhere on the model to focus it, and use the - (minus) or + (plus) key <i>without</i> pressing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key.
